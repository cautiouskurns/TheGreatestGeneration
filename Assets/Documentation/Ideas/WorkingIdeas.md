## 1. Resource System

**Tasks:**

- Create a `ResourceManager` that tracks all resources globally
- Implement resource types (basic: food, materials, labor, wealth)
- Add resource storage and transportation mechanics
- Build a resource UI panel showing current stocks and flows

**Implementation Details:**

- Extend `RegionEntity` to include resource production and storage
- Create a resource distribution algorithm for moving resources between regions
- Add seasonal/terrain effects on resource production

## 2. Infrastructure System

**Tasks:**

- Create infrastructure types (transportation, production, research, etc.)
- Implement tiered infrastructure levels with increasing costs and benefits
- Build UI for viewing and upgrading infrastructure
- Add maintenance costs for infrastructure

**Implementation Details:**

- Add `InfrastructureComponent` to `RegionEntity`
- Create infrastructure adjacency bonuses (e.g., connected roads boost trade)
- Implement visual indicators for infrastructure levels on the map

## 3. Economic Cycle System

**Tasks:**

- Implement the four-phase economic cycle (expansion, peak, contraction, recovery)
- Create sector-specific modifiers for each phase
- Build UI to display current economic phase and forecasts
- Add events triggered by phase transitions

**Implementation Details:**

- Create an `EconomicCycleManager` that progresses through phases
- Implement probability-based phase transitions
- Add special events that can occur during specific phases
- Create visual theming for the UI based on the current phase

## 4. Project System

**Tasks:**

- Create a project queue for each region
- Implement different project types with various costs and benefits
- Build UI for selecting and managing projects
- Add project completion events and animations

**Implementation Details:**

- Create `ProjectEntity` class with costs, duration, and effects
- Implement resource consumption and turn-based progress for projects
- Add construction visualization on the map
- Create special projects that unlock new capabilities

## 5. Basic AI Implementation

**Tasks:**

- Create simple AI prioritization for competing nations
- Implement basic diplomatic relations between nations
- Build AI decision-making for project selection and resource allocation
- Add AI personality traits that affect decision-making

**Implementation Details:**

- Create an `AIManager` that handles decisions for non-player nations
- Implement a priority scoring system for different actions
- Add basic diplomatic stance tracking between nations
- Create simple trade AI for resource exchange

## 6. Gameplay Balance and Progression

**Tasks:**

- Create a technology system for unlocking new capabilities
- Implement victory conditions and scoring
- Add starting game scenarios with different difficulty levels
- Balance economic parameters for engaging gameplay

**Implementation Details:**

- Create a tech tree with unlockable technologies
- Implement scoring based on various economic metrics
- Add game scenario scriptable objects for different starting conditions
- Create a game settings system for adjusting simulation parameters

## Development Sequence Recommendation

1. Start with the resource system as the foundation
2. Add the economic cycle system to create the core game rhythm
3. Implement infrastructure and projects as ways to interact with the economy
4. Add AI as the final layer to create dynamic competition

This approach builds each system on top of the previous one, allowing you to test and refine the gameplay at each stage.
