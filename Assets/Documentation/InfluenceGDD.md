# 1. Game Design Document

## 1. Game Overview

- **Title**: Economic Cycles
- **Genre**: Roguelike Grand Strategy + Economic Simulator
- **Pitch**: A satirical economic strategy game where players guide a nation through booms, busts, and generational change in a world of absurd policies, trade rifts, and bureaucratic comedy.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

- **Turn Structure**: Strategic Assessment → Development Decisions → External Relations → End Turn Processing
- **Run Structure**: 30–40 year runs; generational shifts simulate longer-term change, affecting resources, infrastructure, and narrative state.
- **Meta-progression**: Unlocks new nations, policies, and conditions over multiple runs.

## 5. Major Game Systems

### 5.1 Economic System
- Sectors: Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, etc.
- Inputs/outputs, infrastructure multipliers, labor dependency
- Implements Cobb-Douglas production (Output = A × L^α × K^β)
- Economic cycles apply phase-based multipliers to wealth and production
- Price volatility introduces strategic unpredictability in supply-demand balancing

### 5.2 Resource System
- Primary (timber, food) and secondary (textiles, consumer goods)
- Regional surplus/shortage mechanics and interdependence
- Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand imbalance and elasticity
- Substitution logic via cross-price elasticity

### 5.3 Population System
- Labor availability, satisfaction, unrest
- Class dynamics and demographic shifts
- Wealth-based consumption modeling
- Unmet needs lower satisfaction and trigger unrest events

### 5.4 Infrastructure & Projects
- Level-based bonuses
- Enables regional specialization and unlocks
- Infrastructure boosts production efficiency
- Maintenance cost reduces wealth each turn

### 5.5 Event & Narrative System
- Triggered by cycles, policies, population status
- Ties back to tone and world state
- Supports conditional dialogue with player stats (e.g., Charisma, Intelligence)
- Implements modular narrative logic (intro → choice → consequence)
- Tracks event flags like “MediaScandalActive” for persistent outcomes

### 5.6 Diplomacy & Trade (Planned)
- Future expansion with routes and inter-nation strategy

## 6. Meta Systems & Replayability

- Generational transitions simulate legacy and systemic decay/progress
- Unlockable nations, ideologies, technologies
- Randomized events and world states ensure variation
- Thought Cabinet system:
  - Ideologies are discovered or chosen through events or conditions
  - Thoughts require incubation (delayed activation) and provide permanent buffs/debuffs
  - Ministers and factions react to ideological shifts
  - Conflicting ideologies block each other, shaping national doctrine

## 7. Narrative, Tone & Worldbuilding

- Fictional historical era: 16th–17th century inspiration
- Nations loosely inspired by real cultures
- Humor via satire, cosmic weirdness, and bureaucratic absurdity
- Anachronisms: TikTok guilds, Ministry of Optimistic Projections
- Ministers maintain relationships and memory of player decisions
- Dynamic events evolve from simulation context and active ideologies
- Anachronistic and surreal events integrated into narrative layers

## 8. Art & Visual Style

- Satirical and stylized historical map presentation (planned)
- Dashboards and region overlays over pure visual fidelity
- Event cards with illustrations and flavor text

## 9. UI/UX Design

- Region dashboards and nation-wide summaries
- Minimal micromanagement, high-level directives
- Emphasis on readable data and player comprehension

## 10. Technical Design

- **Architecture**: ECS + MVC hybrid
- **ScriptableObjects** for static data: nation, project, terrain, events
- **EventBus** system for decoupling
- Modular, debug-driven prototyping
- Unity + editor tools for turn simulation
- Dialogue engine supports stat-based skill checks and dice rolls
- Event system supports delayed callbacks and chained consequences
- National stats stored in runtime component and updated from game state
- Debug-first tooling used to prototype and test economic logic and narrative flow

## 11. Milestones & Implementation Strategy

- Core loop in place via editor/debug windows
- V1: full economic simulation of a single region
- V2: add multiple regions, UI overlays, and full project system
- V3+: events, generation shifts, meta-progression, diplomacy

## 12. Design Pillars & Constraints

- Systemic over scripted
- Strategic, not micromanaged
- Replayability via variation and legacy
- Humor as a spice, not the dish

## 13. Appendices

- Glossary
- Debug tools and simulation functions
- System flow diagrams (pending)
- Pseudocode for turn logic and economic processing

## Appendix: Design Notes and Future Concepts

This appendix contains design ideas that are not yet part of the core GDD, but may be integrated or expanded upon in future iterations.

### 🧮 Economic Model Extensions

- **Supply & Demand Mechanics**
  - Dynamic price = BasePrice × (1 + (Demand - Supply) / Elasticity)
  - Elasticity varies per resource
  - Demand influenced by population, wealth, infrastructure
  - Supply driven by infrastructure, terrain, and production efficiency

- **Elasticity & Substitution**
  - Income elasticity: richer populations consume more
  - Cross-price elasticity: substitution logic (e.g., rice vs bread)

- **Cobb-Douglas Production Function**
  - Output = A × L^α × K^β
  - A = productivity factor; L = labor; K = capital; α/β = elasticity coefficients

- **Infrastructure Impact**
  - Efficiency boost = 1 + level × modifier
  - Potential decay and maintenance costs

- **Consumption Modeling**
  - Wealth-based consumption formula
  - Unmet demand leads to unrest and stagnation

- **Economic Cycle Integration**
  - CycleEffect = PhaseModifier × Coefficient
  - Influences production, unrest, prices

- **Price Volatility**
  - Price(t+1) = Price(t) + α × (SupplyShock - ConsumptionTrend)
  - Random market shocks and feedback loops

### 🎭 RPG-Style Event Mechanics

- **Player Stats & Traits**
  - Charisma, Intelligence, Political Capital, Credibility, etc.
  - Tracked in a PlayerStats component

- **Skill Checks & Dice Rolls**
  - Dialogue outcomes gated behind skill thresholds or random rolls
  - Simple d20 implementation for choice branches

- **Event Memory System**
  - Choices leave flags like “MediaScandalActive = true”
  - Affects future event branches and tone

- **Minister & Faction Relationships**
  - Track trust/distrust levels with key characters
  - Choices influence future support or conflict

- **Conditional Dialogue Templates**
  - Modular text built from:
    - Intro → Conflict → Choice → Consequence
  - Context-aware fragments use game state variables

### 🧠 National Thought Cabinet System (Inspired by Disco Elysium)

- **Core Concept**
  - Ideologies or doctrines are researched like "thoughts"
  - Incubation period → permanent nation-level modifier

- **Examples**
  - “Agrarian Exceptionalism”: Boosts food output, slows industry
  - “Invisible Hand Manifesto”: Improves market efficiency, raises inequality

- **Incubation Effects**
  - Temporary instability, bureaucracy conflict
  - Ministers react, events adapt

- **Systemic Hooks**
  - Modify equations (production, pricing)
  - Alter faction satisfaction and unlock content
  - Conflicting doctrines block each other

### 🌐 Roguelike Event Tree

- **Branching Nodes**
  - Events, crises, ideologies form a branching meta-structure
  - Players navigate ideological progression like a policy map

- **Reactive Progression**
  - Nodes appear based on state triggers or economic phases
  - Player decisions or world conditions unlock future branches

- **Dynamic Outcomes**
  - Narrative arcs change based on prior decisions
  - Meta-paths shape tone and direction of the run

### 🧰 Real-Time & Tick-Based Hybrid Time Model

- Time flows in months/weeks; events trigger asynchronously
- Nodes or crises trigger automatically or are queued for player decision
- Events create a living, reactive policy layer over a stable economic sim

### 🎨 Visual & Thematic Concepts

- **Visual Style**
  - Bureaucratic retro aesthetic (folders, stamps, maps, red tape)
  - Stylized dashboards and absurd paperwork UI

- **Narrative Flavor**
  - Ministers with ludicrous titles
  - Events range from plausible crises to surreal absurdities
  - Tooltip humor and achievement flavor text

- **Audio Direction**
  - Ambient orchestral or lo-fi industrial
  - Thematic cues for satire, crisis, or prosperity

### 📌 Future Development Concepts

- Policy tech tree vs. event chaos layer
- Emergent ideology blending (e.g., technocratic populism)
- Replay map showing past generations' ideologies and events
- Experimental debug-first scripting for narrative flow control
- Procedurally generated historical timeline
- Constrained number of actions/interactions/influence in a given area/time 
- Monthly newspaper published chronicaling your game

# 2. Project Plan
